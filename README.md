# Extract-subset-from-coco
In the past days, I have tried many methods to extract specific data from coco-format dataset. The dataset may not launch by coco official, but any other dataset in coco-format, the dataset I used is FashionPedia, which contains many accessory imgs.
I now share some experience and related code in the repo

## The repo will attach 3 py file, or more, but generally could divided into 3 stage
So the code will named Stage{}, each file I will try to write some annotations
